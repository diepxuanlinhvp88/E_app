Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies",

Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies",

So wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the HDMI slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable. The firestick worked well with monitor. What's even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same Samsung TV using this cable. Problem solved",

Besides the air mouse and motion gestures everything else works absolutely fine.Also the lightweight remote and its form factor feels really nice and cozy in hands. However the buttons have no dots or rivets over its buttons which sometimes makes you forget which key you are pressing.Other than that its a great remote controller.",

It supports Samsung Smartview and DEX out of the box which means without any internet and wifi etc you can directly cast your screen. Super handy. The sound quality is just so so great for the price. The Remote gets synced with the Airtel DTH and there is dual band support. The HDR gets detected and auto upscaled for Full HD contents in the Hotstar and Netflix. The only cons I find is the power usage which is 100Watt and the smart assistant is pretty useless. The WebOS btw has all essential apps.About VU: Installation is done same day. i cant comment on the durability and future support now. But thats common for all TV comps today except Samsung",

But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it's sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.",

Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes",

This makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor. I have been using it for the past 2 months and haven't faced any issue.Another problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only. But replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for meFinal verdict: good monitor wall mount easily taking 5kg of weight on it.Could have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be more",

I could see that they were holding the TV panel while getting the TV out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they weren't. Also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the Screen.Howerver very satisfied with the Sony Installation.

But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it's sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.",

Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range.

This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given.

I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.",

Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..",

And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..",

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.",

Again a job of the design / tech / UI team.

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.",

Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case",

Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.",

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue",

This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given.

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.",

Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months",

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue",

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue",

Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months",

Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:\"Don't just be loud",

I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.",

Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..",

Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..",

Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range.

It has total 3 pair or ear tips (2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone).  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So",

Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..",

And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..",

The bass doesn't overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don't interfere with it (Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!).  1.3 Bass: Punchy and tight.

                "review_content": "[Updated]  Overall you really get what you pay for. They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn't work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe I'll get used to it. We'll see.----------------------------------------------------------This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. I'll post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.Package : The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.Build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.Comfort : This is very subjective and each ear is different. It's one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if I'm OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have \"Gandhi\" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.Sound quality : I liked them. I'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/J0a2Prc_MQo and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.Call quality : In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. Seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.Range : max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess that's passable.Pairing :------ UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022  - - - - - -Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------I don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - Actually I'm not even sure these support it.

You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.Battery life : Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80% charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case - Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red & white to indicate pairing",

Then the rest go out while the music is on.. Dual mode is good.. But don't think anyone would use the normal mode.. Cant use the phone eq on nt headphones thats a down side.. But u can use other third party eq or the eq in Spotify or saavn works.. The headphones itself might feel it could break cos all of it is made of plastic.. But feels like its a good one... And wont break .. The pads are soft it dosent hurt the head or the ear.. Used it for hours.. Been hearing from a lot of review about the sound quality of these.. But believe me most of them r giving the review after using it for the first time.. Headphone guide 101 u need to burn the drivers I mean u need to use the headphones for a couple of days to get its full potential.. And sound quality is very good.. Vocals are easyly separated bass is enough.. Treble is the right amount (the way I like it) sound stage is good due to being a on ear with big dynamic driver.. And u would feel the richness of the sound cos of the brand.. A better headphone is the one which creates good and detailed sound.. Not those who are loud.. So yeah I would recommend this over boat. And one last thing.. Due to it being only a bt headphone and no aux cable is available.. The sound quality deepeneds on the device ur using the Bluetooth quality and the amount of sound out put it can produce.. U can charge it with ur nrml charger if its 5v .. Do not use fast charger.. Been using it for two days now.. Need to burn them drivers more.. And will update on the sound quality.. And yeah the battery back up is really good have used it for almost 4/5 hours still 70% charge left.. It shows in the bt connectivity sec on ur phone.. At the end if ur looking for a headphone with a good premium look a well reputed brand and great sound quality do buy this without a doubt.. This r satisfactory very much.. Go for it.P. S Amazon delivery is really not up to the mark.. Even being a reputed company and all ow and another thing saw some complain about it being manufactured in china mine says manufactured in Malaysia.. Yes its a original one have registered it with harman audio..",

I bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. Wanted to buy this Qubo camera and give it a try as this is Made in India and from the famous Hero Group. The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observations:Pros:- Excellent in performance.- Accurate in motion detection.- Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons:- Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating.- The LED doesn't glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!",

Get it!It is my second time getting this keeb as I had modified (foam+tape mod) and sold my first one which I had brought from elitehubs I was going to get it again from them but they lost my account from their server T_T which I had a few cashbacks balance on.Pro's: 1000hz polling rate! ( Confirmed and checked using USB Viewer by Microsoft)  Best RGB leds I've seen on a keyboard under 8K these things are bright & vibrant af  Great clicks especially for a linear switch  Decent enough build quality  Angled Usb C port at the side (life saver for  me) |  Feels great for typing and gaming  Looks great  Con's: There aren't any con's if you get this keeb! but just to be Nit-picky  1. I would say that the switch and keycap puller that comes with this board is better if not used as the quality of it a bit on the lower side and it has a tendency to damage switches while pulling them out  2. The software is sweet and simple but some more features can be added.  That's it",

The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.However it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow. I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. It's the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a year's usage. And to make it worse there's dismal after sales service.I tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasn't stable. I think I'll finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. Hopefully I'll find a good maker .",

For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I don't regret it. Both of them fir very well into my work type and they've made my life a lot more easier.This is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasse(I checked).

This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle. For example when I set 160°C then it is burning toasts and onions... When I set one step lower it is 130°C and it is not enough for frying :(((.Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware. And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges... You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle",

                "review_content": " and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside :((( The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so I'm sure the fault is in this philips stove... You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed :((( And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... I'm really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is \"pause\" button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat - It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off",

                "review_content": " light up again and then find right flame again... Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is 'stirr fry' button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set :((( ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won't let you or let you to do only one '-' but not 2 times '-'. Why??? I don't know probably ill will... You need to first press \"manual\" button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press +/- and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press 'manual' and +/- to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it",

These are mentioned in the manual.  So this can be thought of as a warmer + boiler.  So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.Accessories: Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.

You need to run it at max thermostat and with full load 2500 or 2900 W and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth. I was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off. Thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on.For such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often.

Big mess so i suggest that you try it with water in a cup or bowl to get the feel of it. Then you will fall in love with this gadget. Easy to clean just rinse under the tap. The charge holds up just about for a job so you don't burn or heat up the motor. Frothing for a cup of coffee or creaming eggs for a fluffy Omelette is easy peasy. Flimsy for ruff use but hey you can't complain for the price your paying.",

Steam consumes water very quickly like I used 100ml twice for 3 apparels.. Color variation observed from image on box and original product inside. Finally work wise okay and job done.

With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesn't converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible",

I was not aware of the process that you can't have it like the normal coffee so I tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won't get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it. Then I went online to understand the process where I came to know about this coffee maker. I bought it for 2cup coffee which cost me 299/-. You can get bigger one also for 4 or 6 cup. You can go through the process of how to make south Indian filter coffee online. To me it does job very efficiently and finally I am able to have a good cup of filter coffee. Now about the product it's not premium quality steel but it's a decent one and it's very easy to use. You fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night. So to me it's a value for money if you want to try filter coffee.",

The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again.
